_Success_: User views leaderboard and is happy to see that they are in the top 10. User is motivated to continue using SparkPet and wants to stay in the top 10. User selects other users on the leaderboard to view their profiles and see what their pet looks like.

## User Types
1. Pet owner/non-pet owner
2. Exercise enthusiast/sedentary
3. Already tracks steps/does not track steps

## Recruitment

Participants were recruited through the project team's friends, family, and classmates. All participants used the application running on an Android device. Participants were asked to complete a consent form prior to the usability test. Participants were not compensated for their time.

## Consent Form

[Here](/consent) is a copy of the consent form used for this user study.
A hard copy of the signed consent form for each participant has been collected by the project team.

## Procedure

The application was loaded onto each user's phone. Each user was given a brief introduction to the concept of the app and were informed that they were required to meet a goal of 2,000 steps in the next 24 hours or their pet would suffer. Users were instructed to meet with the project team the following day to discuss their experience with the application.

After 24 hours, the project team met with each user individually to discuss their experience with the application. Each of the scenarios above were presented to the user. The project team observed the user's interaction with the application and took notes on the user's experience. At the conclusion of the test, the project team asked the user to provide feedback on the application.

## Participants
