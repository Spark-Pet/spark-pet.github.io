#### Scenario 1

5. Your pet looks a little boring, so you want to purchase an accessory for it.

6. You have purchased a pet accessory and you want to equip it on your pet.




## User Types
A subsection called “User Types”. For example, if your app is about pet health, then important user types might include “pet owner” and “veterinarian”.

## Recruitment

A description of how participants were recruited.

A copy of the consent form you used, verification that you obtained consent from all participants, and a notice that a hard copy of the signed consent form for each participant has been collected by the project team.
An anonymized description of the participants. This includes their “type” and perhaps other relevant information. For example, if your app is about pet health, you might want to know if the user is an experienced pet owner or a novice pet owner. You might want to know if the user’s pet currently has health problems or not. You can identify each participant with a letter such as “A”, “B”, “C”, etc. You should have at least 5 participants.
A description of when and where the usability test took place.
The script that was used during the usability test.
The “raw data” collected during the test. Record what happened, for each participant, for each scenario. Indicate if they used their own device, your device, or an emulator.
The “results” of the test. This includes the top three (or so) usability problems that were discovered by the test. Please create issues in your project board to document the tasks required to address these usability problems, and provide links to each issue created as a result of this test in your report. Karma points if you are able to fix and close any of these issues prior to final project submission!
