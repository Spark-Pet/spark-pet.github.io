Keep walking - your pet's life depends on it

## Motivation
Many people live sedentary lifestyles and lack the motivation to exercise. SparkPet is a mobile app that encourages users to exercise by gamifying movement. The app allows users to create a virtual pet that they must keep alive by walking - the pet's health is directly tied to the user's walking habits. If the user fails to walk enough, their pet will die.

## Goals
* Create an accessible, easy-to-use mobile app that motivates users to create healthy, sustainable habits by gamifying exercise.
