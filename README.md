Keep walking and everyone will survive

## Motivation
Many people live sedentary lifestyles and lack motivation to exercise. SparkPet is a mobile app that aims to motivate users to exercise by gamifying movement. The app allows users to create a virtual pet that they must keep alive by walking. The pet's health is directly tied to the user's walking habits. The more the user walks, the healthier their pet will be. If the user fails to walk enough, their pet will die.

## Goals
* Create an accessible, easy-to-use mobile app that motivates users to create sustainable habits by gamifying exercise.
